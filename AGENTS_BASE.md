# Agent Notes

## Main Repo
- `TEST-uk-aq-ops` is the main repo for this project and the default starting point for cross-repo work.
- Ops repo path: `/Users/mikehinford/Dropbox/Projects/UK-AQ Website & Network/TEST UK-AQ GH Repos/TEST-uk-aq-ops`.
- Do not inspect or modify any `LIVE` repo unless the user explicitly asks.

## Codex operating mode
Default mode is code-only implementation.
Codex should:
- make focused code, schema, non-system documentation, and test edits requested by the task;
- run only fast, local, non-destructive checks needed to verify the edit;
- provide a clear manual validation and deployment plan;
- include exact SQL, gcloud, wrangler, GitHub Actions, and Supabase commands for the user to run manually.
Codex must not, unless explicitly asked:
- create, amend, or otherwise modify Git commits;
- run SQL against live/test Supabase databases;
- apply migration files;
- deploy Cloud Run services, Workers, or GitHub Actions workflows;
- run backfills, reconciliations, bulk jobs, or long-running data jobs;
- run broad external API fetches;
- repeatedly inspect cloud logs;
- make operational changes in GCP, Supabase, Cloudflare, R2, Dropbox, or GitHub settings.
When database or deployment work is needed, Codex should stop after producing:
1. files changed,
2. tests run,
3. exact manual commands,
4. expected outputs,
5. rollback notes,
6. post-deploy validation checklist.

## Permission levels
Unless the prompt says otherwise, use Level 1.
### Level 1 — Code only
Edit files and run small local/static tests. Do not touch external services or databases.
### Level 2 — Local validation
Level 1 plus local-only scripts/tests that do not call Supabase, GCP, Cloudflare, R2, Dropbox, or external APIs.
### Level 3 — Assisted operations
Prepare SQL, deploy commands, and validation commands, but do not run them.
### Level 4 — Execute operations
Only when explicitly requested in the prompt. May run database, deployment, or cloud commands.

## System Documentation Ownership

- Codex and other coding agents must not create, edit, move, rename, or delete files under `system_docs/`.
- Coding agents may read `system_docs/` for context, but it is read-only to them.
- When implementation changes require system documentation changes, the coding agent must identify the affected documents and provide a concise handover for ChatGPT in Chat mode.
- The handover must summarise the implemented behaviour, files changed, schema or configuration changes, deployment implications, and validation results needed to update the documentation accurately.
- Updating `system_docs/` is reserved for ChatGPT in Chat mode using the coding-agent handover and the implemented repository changes as source material.

## Schema
- Permission confirmed: all files under `/Users/mikehinford/Dropbox/Projects/UK-AQ Website & Network/TEST UK-AQ GH Repos/TEST-uk-aq-schema` may be edited (except `archive/`).
- Read the schema files at the start of the session.
- Schema edits in the allowed paths do not require extra confirmation (except under `archive/`).
- Canonical SQL DDL must live in the schema directory at `/Users/mikehinford/Dropbox/Projects/UK-AQ Website & Network/TEST UK-AQ GH Repos/TEST-uk-aq-schema/schemas/`, not only in ingest/ops worker folders.
- When adding/changing Obs AQI tables, update both:
  - `schemas/obs_aqi_db/uk_aq_obs_aqi_db_schema.sql` (main schema file), and
  - a focused schema SQL file in `schemas/obs_aqi_db/` if one is used for targeted apply.

## Naming
- Prefer `uk_aq` in filenames, scripts, and docs (avoid `ukair`).
- `UK-AIR SOS` is a service name and must never be changed to `UK-AQ SOS`.
- AQ means Air Quality in this project.
- Use project terminology: "timeseries" (not "sensors") in code, docs, and discussion.
- For SOS-derived UK networks, use `gov_uk_<network>_` prefixes (e.g., `gov_uk_aurn_`) and place them under `scripts/gov_uk_<network>/`.
- For non-SOS networks, use the network prefix (e.g., `sensorcommunity_`) and place them under a matching `scripts/<network>/` directory.
- Connectors represent data sources; SOS networks live in `sos_networks` (use `network_display_name` for UI) and must not be added to `connectors`. Non-SOS connectors are 1:1 with their network.
- Terminology: `*_ref` = source identifier; `*_code` = internal unique code; `label` = raw source label string; `display_name` = UI-friendly name we curate.
- LAQN is sourced from ERG (London Air), not GOV.UK; use connector code `erg_laqn` with connector-facing prefixes `erg_laqn_` under `scripts/erg_laqn/`.
- For LAQN connectors, use `label` = `ERG London Air` and `display_name` = `London Air LAQN`.
- Use the `laqn_` prefix when referring to the network (not the connector).

## Runtime
- Use `python3` for all Python scripts and commands.
- When writing regex patterns, avoid double-escaping (`\\d`) inside raw strings; use `\d` so year matching works correctly.
- Platform constraint: Supabase Postgres 17 in this project does not support TimescaleDB. Do not suggest TimescaleDB, hypertables, or Timescale compression features; use standard Postgres approaches only.

## Supabase API
- `uk_aq_core`, `uk_aq_raw`, and `uk_aq_public` are exposed to PostgREST.

## Archive
- Files in `archive/` can be referenced for context but must never be modified once created. Adding new files/directories under `archive/` is allowed.
- Archive snapshots are restricted to active, non-test implementation code.
- Never create archive copies for documentation, including anything under `system_docs/`, tests, test fixtures, snapshots, test data, generated outputs, or other non-code files.
- Do not create archive copies for routine or small code edits by default.
- Create archive snapshots only before major or high-risk changes to active non-test code, and whenever the user explicitly asks to archive an in-scope code file.
- Each source code file may be archived at most once per calendar day. If it already has a snapshot in today’s dated archive directory, reuse that snapshot and do not create another copy.
- Files excluded from archive snapshots rely on Git history and the project’s daily backups.
- For `/Users/mikehinford/Dropbox/Projects/UK-AQ Website & Network/TEST UK-AQ GH Repos/TEST-uk-aq-schema`, edits are allowed for any file except under `archive/` directories. Archive files are read-only; new in-scope code snapshots may be added under `archive/` but must never be modified once created.
- The agent has permission to read files under `/Users/mikehinford/Dropbox/Apps/github-uk-air-quality-networks/CIC-Test` (including subdirectories).
- Archive paths are retired for active execution. Active scripts, workers, services, and runner-path defaults must only target non-archive paths, and archive fallbacks must not be used for active runtime code paths.

## Permissions
- The agent may edit any files without asking for permission, except files under any `/archive` directory and files under `system_docs/`.

## Code removal
- Remove any legacy code if it is definitely redundant.
- This project was never completed, so assume all existing code is still relevant.

## Environment Variables
- Whenever a new environment variable is added to any repo, add a corresponding row to the master CSV at `/Users/mikehinford/Dropbox/Projects/UK-AQ Website & Network/TEST UK-AQ GH Repos/TEST-uk-aq-ops/env-vars-master.csv`. Place it in the correct section, fill in the env var name, default value, and which services require it (GitHub/Supabase/Cloudflare/GCP). Leave the Test Value and Live Value columns blank — the user maintains those.
- Whenever a new env var is added/removed/renamed in ingest workflows or scripts, also update `config/uk_aq_github_env_targets.csv` in this repo so GitHub variable/secret targeting stays correct.
- Keep `scripts/uk_aq_sync_github_secrets.sh` in sync with the target map and env set; update the script when env handling rules or target behavior changes.
- This repo has an env sync script: `scripts/uk_aq_sync_github_secrets.sh`.
- The script syncs `.env` keys to GitHub and packages `.env.supabase` into GitHub secret `SUPABASE_SECRETS_ENV`; ingest Supabase edge deploy workflows apply that payload via `supabase secrets set`.

## Documentation Handover
- Do not modify `system_docs/`; follow the System Documentation Ownership rules above.
- Include the following required documentation changes in the handover to ChatGPT when applicable:
  - add a script note to `system_docs/uk_aq_scripts.md` when new scripts are added;
  - add a per-network document in `system_docs/` when a new network is introduced;
  - update `system_docs/schema-overview.md` when `supabase/uk_air_quality_schema.sql` changes;
  - add a matching document in `system_docs/table_info/` when new tables are added;
  - update `system_docs/uk_aq_edge_functions.md` when edge functions are modified;
  - update the relevant `system_docs/` pages whenever functions or system behaviour change.
- When new edge functions are added under `supabase/functions/`, the coding agent must update `.github/workflows/supabase_edge_deploy.yml` itself and hand the corresponding `system_docs/` update to ChatGPT.
- Tell ChatGPT that `system_docs/` is markdown-only and that data files belong under `network_info/` in the relevant network directory.
- Preserve the naming rule in the handover: single-network files/functions use the network name prefix; all SOS networks use `sos_`; all networks use `uk_aq_`.
- DB schemas live outside this repo at `/Users/mikehinford/Dropbox/Projects/UK-AQ Website & Network/TEST UK-AQ GH Repos/TEST-uk-aq-schema/schemas`.

## Station Name Enrichment
- Keep enrichment logic centralized in `scripts/uk_aq_enrich_station_names.py` so report scripts stay in sync.

## Planning Requests
- When proposing plans, offer more than one option when possible, list pros/cons for each, and recommend which to pick with a brief rationale.
- For every plan, explicitly assess both egress impact and database-size impact. Include those impacts in each option's pros/cons, and use them directly in the recommendation so tradeoffs are clear before implementation.

## Implementation Reporting
- When changing code, schema, workflows, or config, always include clear implementation steps in the response.
- Implementation steps must state what changed, which files were changed, and any required apply/deploy/run commands.
- If no code changes were made, state that explicitly.

## Website Polling Policy
- Never suggest reducing website polling frequency below 1 minute.
- Treat 1-minute website polling as a fixed requirement when proposing egress optimizations.

## Supabase Egress Policy
- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, "egress" means **Supabase billable egress** (bytes leaving Supabase to external callers).
- Do not treat request upload payload metrics (for example `uk_aq_public.uk_aq_observation_rpc_metrics_minute.payload_bytes`) as Supabase egress; those are client-to-Supabase uploads and should be described as ingress/upload bytes.
- When reporting egress changes, clearly separate:
  - endpoint response egress estimates (`uk_aq_public.uk_aq_endpoint_egress_metrics_minute`)
  - write/upload payload metrics (`uk_aq_public.uk_aq_observation_rpc_metrics_minute`)
- Do not claim a Supabase egress improvement from write-path refactors unless endpoint/API egress metrics (or Supabase billing/usage counters) also move in the same direction.

## R2/Cloudflare Cache Cost Policy
- For AQI history served via R2 + Cloudflare, assume cost is primarily driven by R2 operation counts (especially Class B reads) and Worker request volume, not R2 bandwidth egress.
- Prefer stable request URLs/params for normal traffic so Cloudflare cache can return warm-cache hits.
- Use cache-buster/version params only for diagnostics, forced-refresh actions, or explicit bypass-cache testing.
- When evaluating performance/cost changes, check cache-hit behavior (`CF-Cache-Status`) and distinguish cache-hit traffic from origin-fetch traffic.

## HistoryDB Granularity Policy
- HistoryDB must preserve raw observation granularity at all times; do not propose aggregation/downsampling/rollups as the default storage strategy.
- Do not suggest rollups, downsampling, or any aggregation-based size reduction unless the user explicitly asks for aggregation.
- If aggregation is explicitly requested, state clearly that it reduces query granularity and keep raw-history preservation options separate.

## Search Tool Preference
- Prefer `grep` for text search and file discovery; do not use `rg` unless explicitly requested.
